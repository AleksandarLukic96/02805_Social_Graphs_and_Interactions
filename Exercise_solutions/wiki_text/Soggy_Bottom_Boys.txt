'''''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''''' is a 2000 [[satirical]] [[comedy-drama]] [[Musical film|musical]] film written, produced, co-edited, and directed by [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]]. It stars [[George Clooney]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Tim Blake Nelson]], with [[Chris Thomas King]], [[John Goodman]], [[Holly Hunter]], and [[Charles Durning]] in supporting roles.

The film is set in rural [[Mississippi]] in 1937, and it follows three escaped convicts searching for hidden treasure while a sheriff relentlessly pursues them. Its story is a modern [[satire]] which, while incorporating social features of the [[Southern United States|American South]], is loosely based on [[Homer]]'s epic [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] poem ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite book| title=A companion to the literature and culture of the American south| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjc-tYYLXM0C&q=oh+brother+where+art+thou| publisher=John Wiley & Sons| date=April 15, 2008| isbn=978-0470756690| first1=Richard J.| last1=Gray| first2=Owen| last2=Robinson| url-access=subscription| access-date=November 18, 2020| archive-date=March 15, 2023| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315194400/https://books.google.com/books?id=sjc-tYYLXM0C&q=oh+brother+where+art+thou| url-status=live}}</ref> Some examples of this include [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]], a [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]], and the main character's name, "Ulysses", which is the Roman name for "[[Odysseus]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garner |first=Bianca |date=2018-05-25 |title=O' Brother, Where Art Thou?

Three convicts, Pete, Delmar and leader Ulysses Everett McGill, escape from a [[chain gang]] to retrieve a buried treasure before the area is flooded to make a lake. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a [[handcar]] on a railway. He tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. The trio makes their way to Pete's cousin Wash's house. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash's son helps them escape.

After ditching the young boy, the group, now stranded in the woods comes across a group of churchgoers receiving baptism. Delmar enthusiastically gets baptized along with Pete, but skeptical Everett declines the invitation. As the three continue their travels, they pick up Tommy Johnson, a young black man who claims he [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the devil]] in exchange for the ability to play guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio station where they record a song as the Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after the police discover their car, and they briefly fall in with outlaw [[Baby Face Nelson]]. Unbeknownst to them, the recording as the Soggy Bottom Boys becomes a major hit.

Near a river, the group hears singing. They see three women washing clothes and singing. The women give them [[corn whiskey]] and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes across from him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the women were [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan invites them for a picnic lunch then mugs them and kills the toad.

On their way to Everett's hometown, Everett and Delmar see Pete working on a chain gang. Upon arriving Everett confronts his wife Penny, who changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead. He gets into a fight with Vernon, her new "suitor". Later that night, they sneak into Pete's holding cell and free him. As it turns out, the women had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities. Under torture, Pete gave away the treasure's location to the police. Everett then confesses that there is no treasure. He made it up to persuade the men he was chained with to escape with him to stop his wife from getting remarried. Pete is enraged at Everett, because he had two weeks left on his original sentence, and will likely face fifty more years for the escape.

The trio stumble upon a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally, where Tommy is to be lynched. The trio disguise themselves as Klansmen and move to rescue Tommy. However, Big Dan, a Klan member, reveals their identities. Chaos ensues, and the [[Grand Wizard]] reveals himself as Homer Stokes, a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross, immolating Big Dan.

Everett persuades Pete, Delmar and Tommy to help him win back his wife. They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending, disguised as musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd knows the now popular song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd [[Riding a rail|runs him out of town on a rail]]. Pappy O'Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to remarry Everett on the condition that he find her original ring.

The next morning, the group sets out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley that Everett had earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of having received pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. As Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded{{efn|The flood is the result of reservoir construction by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]].}} and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it was her aunt's ring. She declares that she will not marry him with that ring, but only her wedding ring, which is still lost.

==Production==
The idea of ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' arose spontaneously. Work on the script began in December 1997, long before the start of production, and it was at least half-written by May 1998. Despite the fact that Ethan Coen described the ''Odyssey'' as "one of my favorite storyline schemes", neither of the brothers had read the epic, and they were only familiar with its content through adaptations and numerous references to the ''Odyssey'' in popular culture.<ref name="Logic Soft Drugs">{{cite book |last1=Ciment |first1=Michel |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5h91ZZemK0C&q=The+Logic+of+Soft+Drugs&pg=PA100 |title=The Coen Brothers: Interviews |last2=Niogret |first2=Hubert |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2006 |isbn=978-1578068890 |chapter=The Logic of Soft Drugs |author1-link=Michel Ciment |access-date=November 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315194427/https://books.google.com/books?id=q5h91ZZemK0C&q=The+Logic+of+Soft+Drugs&pg=PA100 |archive-date=March 15, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref> According to the brothers, Tim Blake Nelson (who has a degree in classics from [[Brown University]])<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tim Blake Nelson biography |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800302265/bio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213139/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800302265/bio |archive-date=2011-06-28 |website=[[Yahoo!

The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 [[Preston Sturges]] film ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'', in which the protagonist (a director) wants to direct a film about the [[Great Depression]] called ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''<ref name="FAQ" /> that will be a "commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, and the problems that confront the average man". Lacking any experience in this area, the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man but is sabotaged by his anxious studio. The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges's film, including scenes with prison gangs and a black church choir. The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges's film.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.filmsite.org/sull.html| title=Sullivan's Travels (1941)| website=AMC Filmsite| last=Dirks| first=Tim| access-date=November 8, 2007| archive-date=October 26, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026092325/http://www.filmsite.org/sull.html| url-status=live}}</ref>

A major theme of the film is the connection between [[old-time music]] and political campaigning in the American South. It makes reference to the traditions, institutions, and campaign practices of [[bossism]] and [[Reform movement|political reform]] that defined Southern politics in the first half of the 20th century.

The Ku Klux Klan, at the time a political force of white [[populism]], is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance. The character Menelaus "Pappy" O'Daniel, the governor of Mississippi and host of the radio show ''The Flour Hour'', is similar in name and demeanor to [[W. Lee O'Daniel|W.&nbsp;Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel]],<ref>{{cite book| last=Crawford| first=Bill| author-link=Bill Crawford (cartoonist)| title=Please Pass the Biscuits, Pappy: Pictures of Governor W.

{{anchor|You Are My Sunshine}}
While the film borrows from historical politics, there are clear differences between the characters in the film and historical political figures. The O'Daniel of the movie used "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" as his theme song (which was originally recorded by singer and Governor of Louisiana [[Jimmie Davis|James Houston "Jimmie" Davis]]<ref name="ROS">{{cite web |year=1998 |title=River of Song: The Artists |url=https://www.pbs.org/riverofsong/artists/e4-jimmie.html |access-date=November 2, 2007 |work=[[PBS]] |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321055444/http://www.pbs.org/riverofsong/artists/e4-jimmie.html |url-status=live }}</ref>), and Homer Stokes, as the challenger to the incumbent O'Daniel, portrays himself as the "reform candidate", using a broom as a prop.

==Music==
{{See also|O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|Down from the Mountain}}
The music was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Producer and musician [[T Bone Burnett]] worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845962.stm| title=O Brother, why art thou so popular?| work=[[BBC News]]| date=February 28, 2002| access-date=February 14, 2012| archive-date=April 5, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405135333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845962.stm| url-status=live}}</ref>

Much of the music used in the film is period-specific folk music.<ref name="Score" /> The selection also includes religious music such [[Primitive Baptist]] and [[spiritual (music)|traditional African American]] [[gospel music|gospel]], most notably [[the Fairfield Four]], an ''[[a cappella]]'' quartet with a career extending back to 1921. The quartet appears in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film's end. Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South: gospel, [[delta blues]], [[Country music|country]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="ridley">{{cite web| url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-22-00/nash_film-lede.html| title=Talking with Joel and Ethan Coen about 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'| newspaper=[[Nashville Scene]]| date=May 22, 2000| access-date=February 14, 2012| last=Ridley| first=Jim| archive-date=February 1, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201045020/http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-22-00/nash_film-lede.html| url-status=live}}</ref>

==Soggy Bottom Boys==
The Soggy Bottom Boys are the fictional musical group that the main characters form as part of the plot; their songs also serve as accompaniment for the film. It has been suggested that the name is in homage to the [[Foggy Mountain Boys]], a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band led by [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Temple Kirby| first=Jack| author-link=Jack Temple Kirby| title=Mockingbird Song: Ecological Landscapes of the South| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjFife4OsCQC&q=foggy+mountain+boys| publisher=[[UNC Press]]| date=November 5, 2009| page=314| isbn=978-0807876602| access-date=November 18, 2020| archive-date=March 15, 2023| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315194433/https://books.google.com/books?id=AjFife4OsCQC&q=foggy+mountain+boys| url-status=live}}</ref> In the film, the actors [[Lip-synching in music|lip-synched]] the songs credited to the band, except for [[Tim Blake Nelson]]'s own voice on "[[In the Jailhouse Now]]".

The band's hit single is [[Dick Burnett (musician)|Dick Burnett]]'s "[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]", a song that had enjoyed much success prior to the movie's release.<ref name="BDR">{{cite web | title=Man of Constant Sorrow (trad./The Stanley Brothers/Bob Dylan) | work=Man of Constant Sorrow | url=http://www.bobdylanroots.com/sorrow.html | access-date=November 2, 2007 | archive-date=October 23, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023053206/http://www.bobdylanroots.com/sorrow.html | url-status=live }}</ref> After the film's release, the fictitious band became so popular that the country and folk musicians whose performances are heard on the film got together for a concert tour called [[Down from the Mountain]], which was filmed for TV and DVD.<ref name="Score" /> They included [[Ralph Stanley]], [[John Hartford]], [[Alison Krauss and Union Station]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[Chris Sharp]], Stun Seymour, [[Dan Tyminski]] and others.
