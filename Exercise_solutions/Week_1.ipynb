Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\\n\\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt\\'s work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]] but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11–13.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age.

For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and \"paint-like\" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref> \\n\\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt\\'s skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\\n\\nLastman\\'s influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631.<ref name=\"Wetering-284\">van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629, he completed \\'\\'[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]\\'\\', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\\n\\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632–1636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (\\'\\'[[The Blinding of Samson]]\\'\\', 1636, \\'\\'[[Belshazzar\\'s Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar\\'s Feast]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1635 \\'\\'[[Danaë (Rembrandt)|Danaë]]\\'\\', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh\\'s workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|\\'\\'Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III\\'\\']]) and large (\\'\\'Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife\\'\\', 1633, \\'\\'[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]\\'\\', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\nBy the late 1630s, Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–165.</ref> At the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–165.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface.

Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8–12</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> He worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]],\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. Of the many hundreds of drawings Rembrandt made, only about two hundred have a landscape motif as their subject, and of the approximately three hundred etchings, about thirty show a landscape. As for his painted landscapes, one does not even get beyond eight works.<ref>\\n\\nChristiaan Vogelaar &  Gregor J.M.

After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of 18 [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight. For [[Théophile Thoré]] it was the prettiest painting in the world. \\n\\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the \\'\\'[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]\\'\\', the musketeer branch of the [[schutterij|civic militia]].

Instead, he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission, though the exact nature of the mission or event is a matter of ongoing debate.\\n\\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left-hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|town hall]] in 1715. In 1817 this large painting was moved to the [[Trippenhuis]].

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future |url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-date=22 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822083100/http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\\n\\nOne example of activity is \\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\', now housed in the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City. Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\', [[Simon Schama]] and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt\\'s authorship feel that the execution is uneven and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the \\'Lisowczyk\\' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., \\'\\'Artibus et Historiae\\'\\', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197–205.

There is a book on the subject:\\'\\'Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?\\'\\' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\\n\\nA similar issue was raised by Schama concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt\\'s works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in \\'\\'[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]\\'\\', recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\'. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp. 582–591.</ref>\\n\\nAnother painting, \\'\\'Pilate Washing His Hands\\'\\', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master\\'s command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |access-date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Outpost Art |archive-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112111138/http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".

There are 49 in the Netherlands, many in the [[Rijksmuseum]], which has \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Jewish Bride]]\\'\\', and the [[Mauritshuis]] in The Hague.<ref>G. Schwartz (1987) Rembrandt, zijn leven, zijn schilderen. </ref> Others can be found in [[The Louvre]], the [[Hermitage Museum]], and [[Nationalmuseum, Stockholm]]. The [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in Warsaw displays two paintings by Rembrandt.<ref name=zamek/>\\n\\nThe largest collections of drawings are in the older large museums such as the Rijksmuseum, Louvre and [[British Museum]]. All major [[print room]]s have large collections of Rembrandt prints, although as some exist in only a single impression, no collection is complete. The degree to which these collections are displayed to the public or can easily be viewed by them in the print room, varies greatly.\\n\\nThe [[Rembrandt House Museum]] has fittings and furniture that are mostly not original but period pieces comparable to those Rembrandt might have had, and those in the many drawings and etchings set in the house, and contemporary paintings reflecting Rembrandt\\'s use of the house for art dealing. His printmaking studio has been set up with a printing press, where replica prints are printed. The museum has a few early Rembrandt paintings, many loaned but an important collection of his prints, a good selection of which are on rotating display.\\n\\n== Works about Rembrandt ==\\n{{See also|Category:Works about Rembrandt}}\\n\\n=== Literary works (e.g. poetry and fiction) ===\\n* \\'\\'To the Picture of Rembrandt\\'\\', a Russian-language poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], 1830\\n* \\'\\'[[Gaspard de la Nuit (poetry collection)|Gaspard de la nuit: Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot]]\\'\\', a series of French-language poems by [[Aloysius Bertrand]], 1842\\n* \\'\\'[[Picture This (novel)|Picture This]]\\'\\', a novel by [[Joseph Heller]], 1988\\n* \\'\\'Moi, la Putain de Rembrandt\\'\\', a French-language novel by Sylvie Matton, 1998\\n* \\'\\'Van Rijn\\'\\', a novel by Sarah Emily Miano, 2006\\n* \\'\\'[[I Am Rembrandt\\'s Daughter]]\\'\\', a novel by Lynn Cullen, 2007\\n* \\'\\'[[The Rembrandt Affair]]\\'\\', a novel by [[Daniel Silva (novelist)|Daniel Silva]], 2011\\n* \\'\\'The Anatomy Lesson\\'\\', a novel by Nina Siegal, 2014\\n* \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Mirror\\'\\', a novel by Kim Devereux, 2015\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n*The [[Donna Summer]] song \\'\\'[[Dinner with Gershwin]]\\'\\' contain the lyrics \"I want to watch Rembrandt sketch.\"\\n*The [[Scott Walker (singer)]] song Duchess features the lyrics “It’s your Bicycle bells / and your Rembrandt swells”\\n\\n=== Films ===\\n* \\'\\'[[The Stolen Rembrandt]]\\'\\', a 1914 film directed by [[Leo D.

This commission consisted of a veterinarian, a circus manager, a cavalry officer, a number of schoolteachers, and the director of the Berlin zoological gardens. This commission concluded in September 1904 that no tricks were involved in Hans\\'s performance.{{ref|hist}}\\n\\nThe commission passed off the evaluation to [[Oskar Pfungst]], who tested the basis for these claimed abilities by:\\n# Isolating horse and questioner from spectators, so no cues could come from them\\n# Using questioners other than the horse\\'s master\\n# By means of [[blinders]], varying whether the horse could see the questioner\\n# Varying whether the questioner knew the answer to the question in advance.\\n\\nUsing a substantial number of trials, Pfungst found that the horse could get the correct answer even if von Osten himself did not ask the questions, ruling out the possibility of fraud. However, the horse gave the right answer only when the questioner knew what the answer was and the horse could see the questioner. He observed that when Hans could see the questioner, the horse got 89 percent (50 out of 56) of the answers correct, but when Hans was not able to see the questioner, the horse answered only six percent (2 out of 35) of the questions correctly.<ref name=\"gutenberg\" /> \\n\\nPfungst was aware of the ability of circus trainers to train horses to respond to small gestures, and was aware of a number of cases of dogs, like that of English astrophysicist Sir [[William Huggins]], who were able to point to an object their master was looking at or who were able to \"bark\" the answer to questions like square roots while staring at their master\\'s face, and so after refuting his initial suspicion of a fraud involving whispering or the like, began to consider accidental communication with Hans.<ref> Oskar Pfungst, \\'\\'Clever Hans: (The Horse Of Mr. Von Osten)\\'\\', Pfungst 1911 [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33936/33936-h/33936-h.htm#Page_177 pp.177]-185</ref> Pfungst then examined the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse\\'s taps approached the right answer, the questioner\\'s [[Human position|posture]] and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap. This provided a cue that the horse could use to tell it to stop tapping. The social [[animal communication|communication]] systems of horses may depend on the detection of small postural changes, and this would explain why Hans so easily picked up on the cues given by von Osten, even if these cues were subconscious.\\n\\nPfungst carried out laboratory tests with human subjects, in which he played the part of the horse. Pfungst asked subjects to stand on his right and think \"with a high degree of concentration\" about a particular number, or a simple mathematical problem. Pfungst would then tap out the answer with his right hand. He frequently observed \"a sudden slight upward jerk of the head\" when reaching the final tap, and noted that this corresponded to the subject resuming the position they had adopted before thinking of the question.<ref name=\"gutenberg\">{{cite web| url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33936/33936-h/33936-h.htm#CHAPTER_IV |title= The Project Gutenberg eBook of Clever Hans (The Horse of Mr. von Osten), by Oskar Pfungst |publisher=Gutenberg.org |access-date=2013-10-21}}</ref>\\n\\nSome critics of Pfungst suggest that a proper way of validating the body language hypothesis should involve Pfungst acting out the same body language cues himself in order to reliably get Hans to give wrong answers. This would have validated the hypothesis that Hans is simply tapping in correspondence with certain body language cues, independently of the true answer; however, Pfungst never was able to successfully validate his hypothesis in this manner. \\n\\nAfter the investigations by Pfungst were done, von Osten, who was never persuaded by Pfungst\\'s findings, continued to show Hans around Germany, attracting large and enthusiastic crowds.{{ref|hist}}\\n\\n==The Clever Hans effect==<!-- This section is linked from [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] -->\\nAfter Pfungst had become adept at giving Hans performances himself, and believed he was fully aware of the subtle cues which made them possible, he discovered that he would produce these cues involuntarily regardless of whether he wished to exhibit or suppress them.{{fact|date=November 2022}} Recognition of this phenomenon has had a large effect on experimental design and methodology for all experiments whatsoever involving sentient subjects, including humans.\\n\\nThe risk of Clever Hans effects is one reason why [[comparative psychologist]]s normally test animals in isolated apparatus, without interaction with them. However this creates problems of its own, because many of the most interesting phenomena in animal cognition are only likely to be demonstrated in a social context, and in order to train and demonstrate them, it is necessary to build up a social relationship between trainer and animal. This point of view has been strongly argued by [[Irene Pepperberg]] in relation to her studies of [[parrot]]s ([[Alex (parrot)|Alex]]), and by [[Allen Gardner|Allen]] and [[Beatrix Gardner]] in their study of the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]]. If the results of such studies are to gain universal acceptance, it is necessary to find some way of testing the animals\\' achievements which eliminates the risk of Clever Hans effects. However, simply removing the trainer from the scene may not be an appropriate strategy, because where the social relationship between trainer and subject is strong, the removal of the trainer may produce emotional responses preventing the subject from performing. It is therefore necessary to devise procedures where none of those present knows what the animal\\'s likely response may be.\\n\\nThe Clever Hans effect has also been observed in [[drug-sniffing dog]]s. A study at [[University of California, Davis]] revealed that cues can be telegraphed by the handler to the dogs, resulting in false positives.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/02/animal_behaviour&fsrc=nwl |title= Clever Hounds|access-date=2011-05-14|date=2011-02-15 |publisher=The Economist | format=URL}}</ref>\\n\\nA 2004 study of [[Rico (dog)|Rico]], a border collie reported by his owners as having a vocabulary of over 200 words, avoided the Clever Hans effect by having the owner ask the dog to fetch items from an adjacent room, so that the owner could not provide real time feedback while the dog was selecting an object.{{fact|date=November 2022}}\\n\\nA study conducted in 2012 examined the socio-communicative ability of dogs with humans, looking at how much of an influence an owner, if present, would have on their dog during an object-choice pointing task, including looking at whether a Clever Hans effect was present. The study concluded that when the experimenter provided a pointing gesture regardless of the owner’s knowledge, and that when no pointing cue was given to the dog, it only performed at chance level. This study proved that, for this pointing task, there was no Clever Hans effect affecting the dogs\\' performance, as long as the owners did not actively influence them.<ref name=\"auto1\">Schmidjell, T., Range, F., Huber, L., & Virányi, Z.

The results showed that the experimenter had the strongest effect on the dog\\'s choice in this task, regardless of the owner\\'s knowledge or actions.

Zoo employees were the first to notice his \"speech\", but he soon delighted zoo-goers at large by appearing to ask his attendants for water and regularly praising or (infrequently) chastising himself.  By 1979, his fame as the \"speaking elephant\" had spread in the wake of various [[mass-media]] stories about his abilities, many containing considerable fabrication and wild conjecture. Batyr\\'s case was also included in several books on animal behaviour, and in the proceedings of several scientific conferences.  These developments drew a spate of zoo visitors, and brought the offer of an exchange—Batyr for a rare [[bonobo]]—from the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[Circus]], an offer rejected by the zoo\\'s employees.\\n\\nA.

By putting the trunk in his mouth, pressing a tip of the trunk to the bottom of the jaw and manipulating the tongue, [the elephant] said words. Besides, being in a corner of the cage (frequently at night) with the trunk softly hanging down, the elephant said words almost silently—a sound comparable with the sound of ultrasonic devices used against mosquitoes or the peep of mosquitoes, which human hearing hears well until approximately the age of 40. While pronouncing words, only the tip of the elephant\\'s trunk is clamped inside [the mouth] and Batyr made subtle movements with a finger-shaped shoot on the trunk tip\".</blockquote>\\n\\nVarious audiovisual recordings were made during Pogrebnoj-Aleksandroff\\'s studies of Batyr and some of these have been transferred to [[Russia]]\\'s [[Moscow State University]] for further study.\\n\\n==Death==\\nBatyr died in 1993 when zookeepers accidentally gave him an overdose of sedatives.<ref>\"The Scene in the Nation and the World\", \\'\\'The Philadelphia Inquirer\\'\\', September 3, 1993</ref><ref>\"Talking elephant silenced forever\", \\'\\'The Washington Times\\'\\', September 3, 1993</ref> His death was reported worldwide.\\n\\n==Lexicon ==\\nIt is claimed that Batyr had a vocabulary of about 20 words in the Russian and Kazakh languages.

The trainer and rival exchange roles so the student can see that the process is interactive. When a student (human or parrot) answers a question about an object correctly, they receive that object as a reward instead of a food reward, which is often used in other training techniques. Irene Pepperberg said the reward system is crucial, because it is the only way that students can make the direct connection between the object and the label that they have used. Food rewards are also sparingly used. Trainers sometimes make intentional mistakes so the students can see the consequences of an incorrect identification. Upon making a mistake, the trainer is scolded and the object is removed.<ref name=\"wise94-96\">{{cite book |title= Drawing the Line|last= Wise|first= Steven M.|author-link= Steven M.

Viki was raised by Keith and Catherine Hayes in the same manner as a [[human]] [[infant]], to see if she could learn human [[word (linguistics)|word]]s. She was given [[speech therapy]], which involved the Hayeses (her adopters) manipulating her lower jaw. Eventually, she was able to voice four words:\\n*mama\\n*papa\\n*up\\n*cup\\n\\nAnalysis on recordings of her vocalizations concluded she was \"incapable of simultaneous recruitment of consonantal “frames” and vowel-like \\'content\\'\" but she \"successfully produced a small sample of humanlike consonantal speech sounds, including labial and, possibly, velar articulations\".<ref name=\"Ekström 2023 pp. 249–253\">{{cite journal |last=Ekström |first=Axel G. |date=2023 |title=Viki\\'s First Words: A Comparative Phonetics Case Study |journal=International Journal of Primatology |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=249–253 |doi=10.1007/s10764-023-00350-1 |issn=0164-0291|doi-access=free }}</ref> \\n\\nAt the time, her extremely limited success was initially interpreted as showing that apes were incapable of using [[human language]]. However, further experiments in which chimpanzees were instructed in the use of [[American sign language]] indicated that Viki\\'s achievements had been significantly hampered by physiological limitations—chimpanzees are not able to produce the sounds that make up [[human speech]]. Viki lived like a human, even with a human sibling, for three years with her trainers, Keith and Cathy Hayes, with the notion that the other failed attempts of teaching a non-human primate a human language failed because these studies used environments too dissimilar to a human\\'s environment when infants learn language. The immersive language experienced failed, however, after three years Cathy Hays said “the only obvious and important deficit in the ape\\'s innate intelligence, as compared with man\\'s, is a missing facility for using and understanding language” (Fitch, 2002). The faculty argument is common in the field of evolutionary linguistics and biolinguistics. [[Noam Chomsky]] called it a \"language acquisition device\" innate to humans which allows for our use of the matured \"language organ\" or faculty (See Hauser, Chomsky, & Fitch, 2002). Chomsky, conceding that language has share components across multiple species and domains, now uses the terms \"Broad\" and \"Narrow,\" Narrow being the only human trait of discrete infinity. \\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[List of individual apes]]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n# Catherine Hayes (1951), \\'\\'The Ape in Our House\\'\\'.
