    "This week we'll talk about advanced network measures (beyond the degree distribution). We will use these tools to make sense of the network of the Comics Characters on Wikipedia. \n",
    "This is the outline for today:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualization and qualitative analysis of the Country Music Artists Network\n",
    "* Properties of the network structure, including how univere-origin and other properties shape the network\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Reading_: This week, the reading is mostly for reference. It's for you to have a place to go, if you want more detailed information about the topics that I cover in the video lectures. Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into [Section 9.4](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9#modularity) in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in [Chapter 7](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/7)\\."

    "Visualization is a big part of network science and (while powerful), the tools built into `NetworkX` are not the most powerful. Therefore, we'll explore another layout in the exercise below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will use the [`ForceAtlas2`](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679) package produces som nice layouts. ForceAtlas2 was developed by the creators of the [Gephy graph analysis software](https://gephi.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the canonical version of ForceAtlas on GitHub ([Force Atlas 2 algorithm](https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2)) isn't being maintained, so we'll use this fork that's continually updating the original source: https://github.com/AminAlam/fa2_modified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Finally, I have to say that the Country Music Network is very much a hairball of interconnections, so not even ForceAtlas2 can extract much structure from it. ***But don't worry ... ForceAtlas2 is still worth your time and we'll untangle the hairball in subsequent exercises***.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Exercise 1:* Plot the Network using ForceAtlas2.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. The [Force Atlas 2 algorithm](https://github.com/AminAlam/fa2_modified) helps calculate more aesthetically pleasing positions for the nodes for your network visualizations.\n",
    ">2. Follow the instructionf on the GitHub page. That page also how to use the package to get coordinates for each node. You can then feed those coordinates to NetworkX (see below).\n",
    "> * Visualize the network using the [NetworkX draw function](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw.html#networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw), and node-coordinates from the force atlas algorithm. As in the previous Exercise:\n",
    ">   * Node color should depend on the `length_of_content` attribute (see notes from last week).\n",
    ">   * Node size should depend on the node *degree*\n",
    "> * Play with the force atlas algorithm parameters to obtain a visualization you like. \n"

    "*Exercise 2*: We continue with a qualitative inspection of the Wikipedia pages. Inspecting the data manually will develop intuitions that will help us to intepret our quantitative results. We investigate the reasons for links between characters to exist on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Consider the nodes with highest in-degree in the network. Open the corresponding Wikipedia page.\n",
    ">   * Consider the set of neighbours pointing towards the node found above. \n",
    ">   * What is the relation between the characters you identified and their network neighbours? (e.g. do they appear in the same comics?, are they opponents?, etc ...). You don't need to come up with a grand theory of Country Music here, I just want you to think about how links arise, why the links are there.\n",
    ">   * Repeat the exercise for the highest out-degree node. \n",
    ">   * Are there differences between reasons for out- and in-links? Again, there's no right answer here. I just want you to think about some of the reasons why links may occur in Wikipedia\n",
    ">4. Create a scatter plot, where each node is a point, and the axes show in- versus out-degree. That way you can visually inspect the patterns of how in- and out-degree are connected across all the nodes in the network.\n",
    ">5. Are there any nodes with high out-degree and with few incoming connections? If yes, open WikiPages of such characters and explain what happens?\n",
    ">6. Are there any nodes with high in-degree and few outcoming connections? Again, open WikiPages of such characters and explain what happens?"

    "*Exercise 3:* Last time we visually analyzed (plotted) the degree distributions of our network. Now, let's analyze it using some of the tools from previous lectures. For this exercise we are going to look at the *directed* graph (rememeber, we asked you to keep one?).\n",

    ">    * To calculate it, you can install [`powerlaw`](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085777) package (I could not install in conda, so I used `pip install powerlaw`)\n",

    ">    * A long time ago, a group of scientists analyzed the network spanned by ***all** of Wikipedia (the paper is called [Wikipedias: Collaborative web-based encyclopedias as complex networks](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.016115); to access this paper, use findit.dtu.dk or read the preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602149)). Do your findings correspond to the results described in Chapter **III.A** of that paper? If not, try to give your explanation of why? \n",
    ">3. Create a scatter plot of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. Comment on the relation between the two.\n",
    ">4. Plot a heatmap [(Hint here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set) of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. What is the advantage of using a heatmap over the scatter plot?\n",
    ">5. Why do you think I want you guys to use a directed graph? Are there questions we can ask using the directed graph that are not possible to answer in the undirected version? Which questions? Can you think of examples when the in/out distinction doesn't matter.\n",
    ">6. We have one more metric that we did not use. The node-attribute `length_of_content`. There are two things we can investigate here.\n",
    ">   * Firstly, we can verify that more text means more links. If that's true the length should correlate with out-degree. Does it? \n",
    ">   * Secondly, and more interestingly, it could be that longer texts means *more famous* characters. And that means more in-links. \n",
    ">   * How should you test this? Well, here you are allowed to be **creative**. You may choose the method of your liking to study this question (e.g. look at it visually, test the correlation using [spearman](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html) or [pearson](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html) correlations, fit a curve to the data, you decide). Once you've tested, let me know. Are both questions true? If yes, which phenomenon is stronger? Explain your results in your own words"

    "We only have one problem. As I explain in the video, the Backbone / Disparity Filter method only works on weighted networks.

Thus, we'll still do the exercises during the following weeks using the full network that preserves all of the connection information.\n"
